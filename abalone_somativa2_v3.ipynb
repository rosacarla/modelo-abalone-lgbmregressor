        " - Entradas: conjunto de dados ```abalone.csv```, composto por 4177 linhas e 9 colunas, com dados de um tipo de molusco marinho (por exemplo, sexo, comprimento, diâmetro, peso, dentre outros), a partir dos quais há como prever a quantidade de anéis (variável “Rings”) do animal; a idade dessa espécie pode ser determinada pela contagem dos seus anéis e, para fazer isto, é necessário cortar a concha do animal e contar os anéis com auxílio de um microscópio.\n",
        " - Saídas: o resultado gera previsões para a variável Rings ou quantidade de anéis do abalone.\n",
        " - Período: são dados sobre 8 características atribuídas ao molusco abalone; não se localizaou a data de coleta dos dados; sabe-se que o conjunto de dados foi doado em 30/11/1995 ao repositório de machine learning da Universidade da Califórnia Irvine.\n",
        " - Objetivo: realizar o treinamento de modelo preditivo com um algoritmo de aprendizagem supervisionada em sequências diferentes de passos e, desse modo, responder à parte 2 da proposta de avaliação somativa da disciplina Técnicas de Machine Learning.\n",

        "A princípio, o modelo LGBM Regressor não teve desempenho melhor do que no treinamento realizado com a Regressão Linear na primeira parte da atividade somativa (demonstrado no notebook abalone-somativa1). Os resultados da RL obtiveram métricas com valores de 0, conforme segue:\n",

        "Nesta segunda parte da atividade somativa, houve duas modificações no notebook. Primeiro, dividiram-se os dados para treino e teste, houve a preparação dos dados, seguida do treinamento. Na segunda alteração, após divisão dos dados, incluiu-se um pipeline contendo a preparação dos dados e treinamento do modelo. Ao finalizar as modificações, as métricas do LGBM apresentaram resultados um pouco melhores dos que os obtidos na tentativa com a Regressão Linear em pipeline com PCA. Seguem abaixo os resultados para comparação do quanto se conseguiu melhorar.\n",

O MAE indica que, em média, as previsões desviam em torno de 1.51 unidades dos valores reais. O RMSE indica que, em média, os erros do modelo atingem 2.17 unidades. Os valores de MAE e RMSE, por serem menores que a Média dos dados de teste (9.84), indicam que o modelo está, em média, fazendo previsões próximas aos valores reais. Em relação ao Desvio Padrão dos dados de teste (cerca de 3.21), MAE e RMSE também são menores. Isto significa que as previsões do modelo estão, em média, dentro da faixa de variabilidade dos dados observados.  \n",
